New features
============

  * |Percona Server| 5.1.49-rel12.0 is based on |MySQL| 5.1.49.

    * ``query_cache_totally_disable`` - Allows the user to disable use of the query cache. (*Oleg Tsarev*, backport from |MySQL| 5.5)

    * ``show_engines`` - Changes ``SHOW STORAGE ENGINES`` to report |XtraDB| when appropriate. (*Oleg Tsarev*)

    * :ref:`remove_fcntl_excessive_calls` - Removes excessive fcntl calls. (*Oleg Tsarev*, port from *FaceBook* tree)

    * :ref:`sql_no_fcache` - Prevents blocks of data from being cached to FlashCache during a query. (*Oleg Tsarev*, port from *FaceBook* tree)

    * ``status_wait_query_cache_mutex`` - Provides a new thread state - "Waiting on query cache mutex". (*Oleg Tsarev*)

    * :ref:`log_connection_error` - Issues the warning “Too many connection” if log_warnings is enabled. (*Oleg Tsarev*)

    * :ref:`response_time_distribution` - Counts queries with very short execution times and groups them by time interval. (*Oleg Tsarev*)

    * :ref:`innodb_buffer_pool_shm` - Allows storing the buffer pool in a shared memory segment between restarts of the server. (*Yasufumi Kinoshita*)

    * Option :ref:`mysql_syslog` was added to the |MySQL| client. If enabled, all commands run on the client are logged to syslog. (*Oleg Tsarev*)

  * New variables introduced:

  * Bug :bug:`576041` - Fixes long stalls while accessing the ``innodb_buffer_pool_pages_index`` table on systems with a large number of tables.
