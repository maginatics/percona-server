New Features
============

 |Percona Server| has ported Twitter's |MySQL| ``NUMA`` patch. This patch implements :ref:`innodb_numa_support` as it prevents imbalanced memory allocation across NUMA nodes. 

Bug Fixes
=========

  |Percona Server| would disconnect clients if ``gdb`` was attached and detached. This was caused by wrong signal handling. Bugs fixed: :bug:`805805` and :bug:`1060136` (upstream |MySQL| bug :mysqlbug:`67052`) (*Laurynas Biveinis*).

  Fixed the upstream |MySQL| bug :mysqlbug:`66890`, where slave server would crash after update statement. Bug fixed :bug:`1053342` (*George Ormond Lorch III*).

  Reads from tablespaces being deleted would result in buffer pool locking error. This regression was introduced by porting the recently introduced InnoDB code to XtraDB in |Percona Server| :rn:`5.5.27-28.0`. Bug fixed :bug:`1042640` (*Stewart Smith*).

  Resolved the *Ubuntu* |Percona Server| package conflicts with upstream packages. Bug fixed :bug:`907499` (*Ignacio Nin*).  

  Crash-resistant replication would break with binlog XA transaction recovery. If a crash would happened between XA PREPARE and COMMIT stages, the prepared |InnoDB| transaction would not have the slave position recorded and thus would fail to update it once it is replayed during binlog crash recovery. Bug fixed :bug:`1012715` (*Laurynas Biveinis*).
