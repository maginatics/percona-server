Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q: Will |Percona Server| with |XtraDB| invalidate our |MySQL| support?
======================================================================

A: We don't know the details of your support contract. You should check with your *Oracle* representative. We have heard anecdotal stories from |MySQL| Support team members that they have customers who use |Percona Server| with |XtraDB|, but you should not base your decision on that.

Q: Will we have to *GPL* our whole application if we use |Percona Server| with |XtraDB|?
========================================================================================

A: This is a common misconception about the *GPL*. We suggest reading the *Free Software Foundation* 's excellent reference material on the `GPL Version 2 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html>`_, which is the license that applies to |MySQL| and therefore to |Percona Server| with |XtraDB|. That document contains links to many other documents which should answer your questions. |Percona| is unable to give legal advice about the *GPL*.

Q: Do I need to install |Percona| client libraries?
===================================================

A: No, you don't need to change anything on the clients. |Percona Server| is 100% compatible with all existing client libraries and connectors.
