Bugs Fixed
===========

  * Bug :bug:`689830` - The development environment tests of ``show_slave_status_nolock`` work only on statement-based replication. They were failing when row-based replication was attempted. A check is now made for the replication type to test.  (*Oleg Tsarev*)

  * Bugs :bug:`688643`, :bug:`691234` - Boolean command line options and configuration variables in the ``slow_extended`` patch were not being processed properly. (*Oleg Tsarev*)

  * Bug :bug:`692211` - Starting the server with a non-zero ``innodb_auto_lru_dump`` value could crash the server if the dump file did not exist. (*Alexey Kopytov*)
