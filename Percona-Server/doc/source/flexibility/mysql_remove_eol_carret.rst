.. _mysql_remove_eol_carret:

=============================
 Handle ``BLOB`` End of Line
=============================

At some point in the past, the |MySQL| command line client was modified to remove ``\r`` before ``\n`` in its input.

This caused problems in some workloads, specifically when loading ``BLOB`` fields containing ``\r`` characters. |Percona Server| solves this by implementing a new command line client option, :variable:`no-remove-eol-carret`.

When the :variable:`no-remove-eol-carret` option is specified, ``\r`` before ``\n`` is not removed.
